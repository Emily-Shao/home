		<h2>I honestly don't have anything impressive to share as my life is pretty boring.</h2>
		<h1>Family</h1>
		<h3> I'm an only child and I live with my parents. They make life stressful but I'm grateful as there are parents far worse. We go places during the summer like
		Niagra Falls and that one museum that was close to it. We also had annual trips to China but that's obviously not happening anytime soon. There really isn't much else to 
		say about them. I also don't have any pictures so just visualise in your head what they would look like</h3>
		<h1>School</h1>
		<h3>I attend school at VPCI to obtain a higher level of education or something like that. But to be honest, I only go to school here because the e-mail came first and I accepted before 
		recieving the other school's e-mail. I don't regret it but if I had the choice to go back in time, I wouldn't be so fast to accept either.</h3>
