		<h1>Watching tv</h1>
		<h2> To be honest, I think this is my only hobby. <a href = "tv.html">Here are some shows I enjoyed watching.</a></h2>
		<h1>Drawing</h1>
		<h2>I don't draw that often but here's a <a href = "drawings.html">link</a> to some of my art.</h2>
		<h1>Watching Streamers</h1>
		<h2>I enjoy listening to twitch streamers when I'm working on something. I think one of the best streamers would be 39Daph. She's canadian and she has a really
		crude and blunt sense of humour which I really enjoy. Daph also has a youtube channel which is basically clips of funny moments in her streams. Here's her most viewed video
		(it's been a while since I've watched it so I can't remember if it's family friendly).
